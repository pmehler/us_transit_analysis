APTA statistical products serve as the definitive resource for industry statistics, primarily the annual Fact Book.  The Fact Book provides a wide range of data for all public transportation systems, including those that do not report to the National Transit Database.  As such, this particular resource is considered the most comprehensive in the transit industry.
